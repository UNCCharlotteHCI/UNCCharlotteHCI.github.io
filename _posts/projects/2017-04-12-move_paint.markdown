description: "Move and Paint is an embodied interactive creative system designed to encourage the elderly to increase their physical activity and to engage elderly populations in creative expression by moving their hands to draw and color on a large screen. Move and Paint uses a Kinect to convert hand and arm gestures to place colors on a scene or drawing on a large projected screen. The Kinect sensor identifies the hands of multiple users and shows them on the screen as a circle of color. The user changes the color by moving the circle to one of a selection of colors across the top of the screen. Users create a painting either by drawing or filling a section of a coloring book image with the color of the circle. The purpose of this study is to understand how elderly populations interact with embodied creativity and explore the difference in exploration, learnability, play, and engagement in the two populations: elderly and college students."
