description: "The willful marionette is an interactive art installation with which people engage in a gesture dialogue. One goal of this project is to explore people's response to a 3D replica of a human body in form of a marionette, and study their interaction through dialogues which comprise only gestures. The computational core of the marionette uses a mapping algorithm with random selection to generate a sequence of gestures in response to detected gestures from people. Several user studies where done throughout the project to investigate participants interest in the marionette as well as usability of the interaction design."
