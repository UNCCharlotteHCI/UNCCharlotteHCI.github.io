description: "The Connected Learning project develops, deploys, and publishes innovative teaching and assessment practices across an undergraduate computing curriculum demonstrating the applicability and efficacy of these practices across a student body diverse in terms of socio-economic status and demographics. The project advances the knowledge and assessment base for scaling educational innovation efforts in computing. We will examine the key factors in building a sustainable practice of educational innovation, which includes faculty attitudinal shifts and infrastructures to support and sustain learning practices."
