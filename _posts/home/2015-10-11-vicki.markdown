<h3>Abstract</h3>
Historically, computing has been envisioned as a way of augmenting human abilities. Nowhere is such a computing goal more evident than in the field of accessibility where we seek to create devices and software to address needs of people who through age or disability face exclusion from full societal participation. In creating accessible technology and novel accessibility tools, research has not only facilitated digital interactions and quality of life needs for many, but also has served to advance the field of computing more generally. The needs of diverse users can and should inform research considerations not only for accessibility specialists, but also more broadly for all who seek to drive the uptake of technology.
