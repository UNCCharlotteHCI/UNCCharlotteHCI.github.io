description: 'The College of Computing and Informatics has a new Makerspace equipped with 3D printers, laser cutters, sewing/ embroidery machines, electronics etc. that is open to all UNCC students, faculty and staff. The HCI lab is interested in studying the interactions that go on within and around the space, particularly in terms of how it is perceived and used by underrepresented minorities in technology. We seek to understand the perceptions and attitudes of users and non-users of makerspaces to inform the design of our own space such that it lives out the message of radical inclusion promised by the maker movement and the population of students using the space is representative of the diverse population of students in the university as a whole.'
