description: Designed to teach the user-centered design and evaluation process.  In particular, students gain hands-on experience with the process of interface design, methods of design, and ways to evaluate and improve the design of interactive software applications in a course-long project.  Students learn how to employ techniques which ensure that end-users are fully considered at all stages of the design process, from inception to implementation.  Assignments involve planning, designing, and conducting studies to learn about user needs; developing the protocols and instruments for data collection; brainstorming, prototyping, and refining interactive solutions for a user problem; and designing and executing user evaluations of interactive software interfaces.
