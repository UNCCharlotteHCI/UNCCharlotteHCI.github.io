description: "This is my first year at UNCC (Fall 2015). I'm interested in exploring art and technology from an HCI perspective: imagining new interaction techniques that inspire creativity as well as studying how these new techniques influence cognition and the creative process. I studied computer science and music as an undergraduate at Wellesley College and I am fascinated now thinking about musical instruments from an interaction perspective and thinking about computers as creative tools."
