description: "IT security problems are a big concern today. To address this problem, I am researching various novel techniques to help software developers detect security vulnerabilities as they are writing code. By using a new annotation technique, dubbed interactive annotation, input from developers can be used to enable tools to assist developers in the detection of application-specific vulnerabilities. Specifically, my research is focused on advancing these techniques."
