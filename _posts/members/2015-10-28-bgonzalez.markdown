description:  "I am passionate about teaching courses on the importance and value of Human Computer Interaction, especially as our reliance on technology moves from recreational to critical. My research is in the areas of novel and embodied interaction techniques, supporting the creative work of artists and choreographers, and understanding how interaction techniques and interface design can impact end-user explorability, satisficing, and satisfaction."
